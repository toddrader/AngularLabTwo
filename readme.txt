ANGULAR LAB PART 2
Task: Convert your markup within index.html into reusable components.
What does the application do?
1. Adds reusable components into the application as well as a nice interaction styling.
Build Specifications:
1. Must include a component for the form called “taskForm”, which will be the markup for
the form.
2. Must include a component for the list called “taskList”. This component will be used to
show the tasks within the list. Use the ngRepeat directive to create a new template for
each task.
3. One directive, at minimum, called “hoverState” for adding a mouseover effect on the
listed tasks. This has to be used on the component with ngRepeat.
